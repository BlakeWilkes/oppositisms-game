# How to Put Your Game on the Web (Mobile Friendly!)

Follow these simple steps to create a link you can text to your friends.

1.  **Open Netlify Drop**
    *   Go to this website: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

2.  **Upload Your Game**
    *   Find the folder named **`deploy`** inside your project folder:
        `/Users/b.wilkes/.gemini/antigravity/playground/velvet-kepler/deploy`
    *   **Drag and drop** that entire `deploy` folder onto the circle on the website.

3.  **Play!**
    *   Wait a few seconds. Netlify will give you a **green link** (like `random-name.netlify.app`).
    *   Click it to test.
    *   **Send that link to anyone!** It will work on their iPhone, Android, or computer.

### Optional: Change the Name
If you want a custom name (like `oppositisms-game.netlify.app`), you can click "Sign Up" on Netlify (it's free) and change the site settings. But the random link works instantly without an account!
